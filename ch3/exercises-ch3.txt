1) create a new list with 3 random strings as elements

2) create a new list with 3 random integers as elements

3) create a new list with 1 integer and 2 strings as elements

4) create list A with 3 strings as elements, copy it to list B

5) same exercise as (4), then remove the last element from list B (and only there)

6) create a dictionary with 3 random keys and 3 random strings as elements

7) same as (6), remove the last element and, for the same key in the dictionary,
  add a list with 3 strings as elements

8) starting from a dictionary as (6), create a method which has as inputs: "key"
(the dictionary key), "value" (the value to add in the list present at key) and
the dictionary itself, make sure that the method adds key+element to the
dictionary or returns an error if it exists

    Example for (8)
    starting with: dictionary['key'] = ['abc', 'ced', 'def']
    call: method('key', 'newvalue', dictionary)
    then the dictionary has: dictionary['key'] = ['abc', 'ced',
                                                  'def', 'newvalue']
9) create a dictionary as (6), with 20 elements (possibly random) and order the
dictionary by value

10) create a dictionary with strings as key and tuple as elements
